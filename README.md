## AI & Outcomes

### AI’s Role in Resolving Key Bugs

bug → impact

### Key Improvements From AI

improvement → impact

-   be aware of possible notches on smartphones → ensured adequate padding at top of nav bar
-   numerous how to wireframe tips → felt more at ease doing a form of design that I had never done before
-   noted my buttons were too small in my wireframe → easier to click on buttons with fingers on smartphones
-   be cautious of dense paragraphs unless necessary → introduction to prevent is more likely to be read when split into three bullet points
-   remove second repeated CTA → looks less pushy on a sensitive website related to prevent
-   remove fixed back to home button → i will have a sticky nav bar so it was redundant
- expose one key nav link in tablet → easier for tablet users to return to the key hero section
- reminder to use whitespace on either side in desktop → shouldn't be taking up the full width of screen like on a smartphone

### Overall Impact of AI on Efficiency

efficiency → impact

-   partially automating commits → easier but ai commit messages often require editing
-   summarizing large chunks of text for comprehension or content → saves time by removing non critical text but have to check that it hasn't omitted something key
